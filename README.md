Completed:

1. [x] Get the Calculator working as demonstrated in lectures 1 and 2. The Autolayout portion at the end of the lecture is extra credit, but give it a try because getting good at autolayout requires experience. If you do not do autolayout, be sure to position everything so that it is visible on all iPhones (i.e. the upper left corner of the scene).
2. [ ] Your calculator already works with floating point numbers (e.g. if you touch 3 ↲ 4 ÷, it will properly show 0.75), however, there is no way for the user to enter a floating point number directly. Fix this by allowing legal floating point numbers to be entered (e.g. “192.168.0.1” is not a legal floating point number!). You will have to add a new “.” button to your Calculator. Don’t worry too much about precision or significant digits in this assignment.
3. [ ] Add the following operations to your Calculator:
  * [ ] sin: calculates the sine of the top operand on the stack
  * [ ] cos: calculates the cosine of the top operand on the stack
  * [ ] π: calculates (well, conjures up) the value of π. For example, 3 π × should put three times the value of π into the display on your calculator. Ditto 3 ↲ π x and also π 3 ×.
4. [ ] Add a UILabel to your UI which shows a history of every operand and operation input by the user. Place it at an appropriate location in your UI.
5. [ ] Add a C button that clears everything (your display, the new UILabel you added above, etc.). The Calculator should be in the same state as it is at application startup after you touch this new button.
6. [ ] Avoid the problems listed in the Evaluation section below. This list grows as the quarter progresses, so be sure to check it again with each assignment.
